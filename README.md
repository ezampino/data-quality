### Data Quality Methods and Tools to Support CTSA Hub Data Sharing

## Problem statement
With the implementation of the new common rule, it is expected that observational research under a waiver of consent using electronic health record data will continue to expand. Yet CTSAs do not have clear pathways on how to expediently allow safe sharing of electronic health data for research. Some CTSAs have laborious honest brokerage processes and others are struggling to tighten their governance to be in full compliance. CTSAs need clear guidelines and governance vehicles to execute safe and compliant data sharing with individual researchers and across institutions. Finally, they need examples and templates to make creation of standardized DUAs and related governance easy to execute, and in a manner that is maximally collaborative and flexible in terms of downstream research.

## Project description

Clear governance pathways within and between CTSAs are needed to expediently allow safe sharing of electronic health data for research. This project provides examples and templates of standardized Data Use Agreements (DUAs) to promote collaborative and flexible data sharing for CTSA hubs.
